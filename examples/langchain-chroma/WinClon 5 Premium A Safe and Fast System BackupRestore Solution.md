WinClon 5 Premium is a system backup/restore solution that uses Alseid engine, a patented original technology, to store the OS, the system area where various applications are installed, and important data in the form of image files to safely restore it to a backup point in the case of a system failure or physical damage to the HDD[^1^]. It supports various Windows-based computing systems, including Windows XP SP3 (32bit), Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, and supports MBR/GPT[^2^].
 
WinClon 5 Premium creates a separate partition that cannot be accessed via the OS in the hard disk as a restoration area to safely store backup images and to perform a quick restoration in the case of a system failure. You can also backup/restore to/from any external device or media. You can choose from different backup/restore methods, such as full Windows partition, selected partition, and full disk. You can also save backup time and disk space by backing up only changes made since the initial backup. You can also set automatic backup and restoration cycles (daily/weekly/monthly) for your convenience[^2^].
 
WinClon 5 Premium also allows you to create bootable media such as DVD or USB so that when a disk is physically damaged, you can boot and restore through the previously created media and backup files. With an easy, simple, and user-friendly interface, WinClon 5 Premium can be used by both system administrators and individual users. WinClon 5 Premium is currently used as the emergency fallbacks, or "reset to factory default" by many OEMs[^3^].
